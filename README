GStage is a ridiculous pet project to emulate the "Global Stage" IRC server
made by QuarterDeck (a company purchased by Symantec). It is actually geared
specifically NOT to be RFC-compliant, as the original server existed.

It will also feature a few notable exploits, including a buffer overflow problem
dealing with extra-long lines that prompted an entirely new version of mIRC.

It's being written as a hobby and out of nostalgia, as this was the server run
by the SciFi (now Syfy, yuck) channel at irc.scifi.com for a number of years
before ultimately being shut down due to hemorraghing users (see the "history"
section on http://www.malkier.net/ for the long drama leading up to it). As it's
just a hobby project, it should probably never be used in a production setting,
but if the SciFi channel can get away with it, hey, maybe you can too.
